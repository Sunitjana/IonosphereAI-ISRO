# 🌌 IonosphereAI: AI-Based Ionospheric Analysis & Prediction

**IonosphereAI** is a deep learning project designed to analyze and predict ionospheric parameters such as **Total Electron Content (TEC)** using space weather data from **GAGAN**, **Polar Cap Index (PCI)**, **Kp**, **Dst**, and **F10.7 solar flux**.  
The project leverages **LSTM-based models** and **deep learning architectures** to understand temporal dependencies in ionospheric variations.
